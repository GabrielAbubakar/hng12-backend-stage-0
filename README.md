# HNG Stage Zero Backend Track
This is my submission for the HNG intership stage 0 task. The project is setup using ExpressJs and only exposes one route, which is the baser url that accepts a GET requests method and returns a json response.


## How to Run
1. First clone the application from the online repository to a local folder using the following command:
```bash
git clone <repository-link>
```

2. Enter into the cloned folder and open a terminal where the following command should be executed to install all of the dependencies of the project:
```node
npm install
```

3. After installation of the dependencies, to get the application running locally, run the following command:
```node
npm run dev
```

4. After executing the command above, navigate to the localhost, [Open Localhost](http://localhost:8000) in order to see the live preview of the application.
